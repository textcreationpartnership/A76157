1. CONFIRMATION
AND
RESTAURATION
The neceſſary means of
REFORMATION
And
RECONCILIATION.

    _ Queſt. Whether thoſe that were Baptized
in Infancy, ſhould be admitted to the
Priviledges proper to Adult Church-members,
without Confirmation, or
Reſtauration, by an Approved Profeſſion
of Perſonal Faith and Repentance?
Neg.

    _ Prop. I. It is here ſuppoſed, that the Infants
of Believers ſhould by Baptiſm be admitted
into the Church, and ſo be partakers of Infant
Priv•ledges.

    _ Prop. 2. There are many Priveledges belonging
to the Adult Members of the Church,
which Infant members are not capable of.

    _ Prop. 3. The Continuation of Priveledges received
in Infancy, is part of the Priveledges
of the Adult; or the Reſtoration of them if they
be loſt.

    _ Prop. 4. The Title-Condition of Infant
Church-memberſhip and Priviledges, is not
the ſame with the Title-Condition of the
Church-memberſhip and Priviledges of the
Adult; ſo that if this new Condition
be not performed when
men come to Age, their former
Title ceaſeth, and there is no other
that ariſeth in his ſtead.

    _ Prop. 5. As a Perſonal Faith is the Condition
before God of Title to the Priviledges of the
Adult; ſo the Profeſſion of this Faith, is
the Condition of his Right before the Church;
and without this Profeſſion, he is not to be
taken as an Adult member, nor admitted to
the Priviledges of ſuch.

    _ Prop. 6. It is not every kind of Profeſſion,
that is the Condition, or neceſſary qualification
of thoſe that are to be admitted to the
Priviledges of Adult members, but ſuch a
Profeſſion as God hath made neceſſaery, by
his expreſs Word, and by the Nature of the
Object, and the Ʋſes, and Ends, to
which be doth require it.

    _ Prop. 7. The Profeſſion of thoſe that expect
the Church-ſttate and Priviledges of the
Adult is to be tried, judged, and Approved
by the Paſtours of the Church, to whoſe
Office it is that this belongeth.

    _ Prop. 8. Though it belong to the Paſtours
Office to judge of the Profeſſion of ſuch expectants,
yet are they bound up by the Laws
of Chriſt, what Profeſſion to accept, and
what to refuſe: and if by breaking theſe Laws
they ſhall dangerouſly, or groſly wrong the
Church: it belongeth to the Magiſtrate to
correct them, and to the people to admoniſh
them, and diſown their ſinne.

    _ Prop. 9. It is moſt evident that Miniſters,
People, and Magiſtrates, have each
a Power of Judging; but different, as they
have different works.

    _ Prop. 10. To this Miniſterial Approbation of
the Profeſſion, and Qualification of the expectant,
there is to be adjoyned a Miniſterial
Inveſtiture, or Delivery of the Benefit
expected.

    _ Prop. 11. The ſolemn Miniſterial Inveſtiture
of Profeſſours, into the Right of the
Church priviledges of the Adult, is either
1. Of the unbaptized, who are now firſt
entered. 2. Or of the Baptized in Infancy,
that never proved ungodly, nor violated that
firſt Covenant. 3. Or of thoſe Baptized,
whether in Infancy or at Age, that have
ſince Proved wicked, and broke that Covenant.
The firſt of theſe Inveſtitures is,
to be by Baptiſm; the ſecond by Confirmation;
and the third by Abſolution. So that
the ſolemn Inveſtiture that I am pleading
for, is by Confirmation to one ſort (that
never proved ungodly ſince their Baptiſm)
and by Abſolution to the other ſort that
broke their Covenant.

    _ Prop. 12. This ſolemn Inveſtiture on perſonal
Profeſſion, being thus proved the Ordinance
of God, for the ſolemn renewing of
the Covenant of Grace, between God and
the Adult Covenanter, it muſt needs f•llow,
that it is a corroborating Ordinance,
and that corroborating Grace is to be expected
in it from God, by all that come to it in
ſincerity of heart: And ſo it hath the name
of Confirmation upon that account alſo.

    _ Prop. 13. Miniſterial Impoſition of hands
in Confirmation, and the fore-deſcribed
ſort of Abſolution, is a lawfull, and convenient
Ceremony, and ordinarily to be
uſed, as it hath been of old by the Ʋniverſall
Church. But yet it is not of ſuch
Neceſſity, but that we muſt diſpenſe in this
Ceremony with ſcrupulous Conſciences,
that cannot be ſatisfied to ſubmit to it.

    _ Prop. 14. Though in Receiving Adult perſons
out of Infidelity by Baptiſm into the
Church; a ſudden Profeſſion without any
ſtay to ſee their Reformation, may ſerve
tu•n; yet in the receiving thoſe that were
Baptized heretofore, into the Number of
Adult-members, or to the Priviledges of
ſuch, their lives muſt be enquired after,
which muſt be ſuch as do not confute their
Profeſſion.

    _ Prop. 15. It is not of flat Neceſſity that the
Profeſſion of the Expectant be made in the
open Congregation, or before many, in order
to his Confirmation and Admittance.

    _ Prop. 16. When a Perſon is admitted among
the Adult-members af a Particular
Church; as well as the Ʋniverſal, his
Profeſſion and Admiſſion muſt be either before
the Church, or Satisfactorily made
Known to the Church at leaſt, who muſt
Approve of it by a Judgment of Diſcretion,
in order to their Communion with him: and
this among us is the ordinary caſe; becauſe
it is the duty of all that have opportunity, to
joyn themſelves to ſome particular Church;
and it is in ſuch Churches, that Communion
in publique Worſhip and Order muſt be
had, either ſtatedly, or tranſiently and
temporarily.

    _ Prop 17. It is convenient, though not of Neceſſity,
that every Church do keep a Regiſter,
of all that are admitted thus into the
Number of the Adult-members.

    _ Prop. 18. Thoſe that were never thus Miniſterially
and Explicitly Approved, Confirmed
or Abſolved (after an ungodly
life,) but have been permitted without it,
to joyne ordinarily with the Church in Prayer
and Praiſes, and have been admitted to
the Communion of the Church, in the
Lords Supper, are approved and confirmed,
Eminently though not Formally: though in
ſo doing, both the Paſtours and themſelves
did ſin againſt God, by the violation of his
holy Order. So that ſuch may be a true
Church, though much corrupted or diſordered.

    _ Prop. 19. So exceeding great and many are
the miſchiefs that have befallen us, by the
neglect of a ſolemn meet Tranſition from an
Infant, into the Adult Church ſtate, and
which undoubtedly will continue, till this
be remedyed, that all Magiſtrates, Miniſters,
and People, that diſſemble not, in
profeſſing themſelves to be Chriſtians,
ſhould with ſpeed and diligence attempt the
Cure.

    _ Prop. 20. So many and great are the Benefits,
that would follow the general practice
of this duty, of Trying, Approving,
and Confirming (or Abſolving) all thoſe
that enter into the number of Adult Chriſtians,
that it ſhould mightily provoke all
Chriſtian Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and
People, to joyne in a ſpeedy and vigorous
execution of it.
